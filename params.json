{"body":"### Welcome Back!\r\nWelcome back.  I hope everybody had a nice vacation.  We'll have a lot to prepare for by June, so let's get started, shall we?  To get back into the swing of things, we'll revisit Susannah's flightmap assignment using object oriented javascript.  First to download the project, open a terminal on your VM, move to a directory where you want to store your folder, and enter the following commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/benhaynor/seatmapjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo start the server, enter the following\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd WelcomeBack\r\n$ dev_appserver.py .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command dev_appserver.py replaces the Google App Engine launcher that you may be familiar with from windows. You should now be able to browse to a nearly blank page by opening a browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).\r\n\r\nWe'll be adding a few features to the seatmap that we worked on last semester.  To get a reminder of what we implemented, visit: [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gd4rXCZBkmmFetru-ujxYTomVgNChCFfySLks__gcBU/edit).
